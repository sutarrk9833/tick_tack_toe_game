# tick_tack_toe_game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. 
The first player to place three of their marks in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—wins the game. 

This project is a simple, browser-based implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with clean styling and intuitive gameplay.
